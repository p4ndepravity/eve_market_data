In the Caldari State, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Bantam.

The Bantam, a strong and sturdy craft, was originally an extremely effective mining frigate.

The Navitas had been a solid mining vessel that had seen wide use by independent excavators, along with being one of the best ships available for budding traders and even for much-maligned scavengers.

In the Minmatar Republic, this led to the redesign and redeployment of the Burst.

The Burst had been a small and fast cargo vessel. This all changed after the redesign, when the Burst found its small-time mining capabilities curtailed in lieu of logistics systems that moved its focus to shield support for friendly vessels.",1420000,17100,260,1,2,None,64,None,306

Its role has evolved through the years, and while its defenses have always remained exceptionally strong for a Caldari vessel, its offensive capabilities have evolved from versatile, jack-of-all-trades attack patterns into focused and deadly gunfire tactics.

One scene that's caused an uproar among various fundamentalist factions involves two of the main characters, Amarr girl Nadira and Brutor male Okar, engaging in a bout of severely salty reparte? immediately followed by quite obviously-hinted-at sexual activity.  In another, the Gallente protagonist, a comely young female, enjoys a sultry dance with two other girls, culminating in a show of half-naked flesh that sent mothers everywhere lunging for their children's eyes.  Mentions and displays of Quafe Ultra during the reel's 89-minute running time number around 110, resulting in an average of 1.23 not-so-hidden advertisements per minute of the film's running time - another reason, critics say, to throw this reel into the jettison canister where it belongs.

Nevertheless, the mere sight of a locked and loaded Wolf should be enough to make most pilots turn tail and flee.

Developer:  Boundless Creation

Boundless Creation's ships are based on the Brutor tribe's philosophy of warfare: simply fit as much firepower onto your ship as possible.  Defense systems and electronics arrays therefore take a back seat to sheer annihilative potential.",1309000,27289,165,1,2,None,436,None,1931

Developer:  CreoDron

As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers.  While sacrificing relatively little in the way of defensive capability, the Ishkur can chew its way through surprisingly strong opponents - provided, of course, that the pilot uses top-of-the-line CreoDron drones.",1216000,29500,165,1,8,None,435,None,1840

2836,358,Adrestia,"The Adrestia is a high-powered blaster platform specially commissioned for the 8th Alliance Tournament. While similar to its sister vessel the Deimos (on which its design was based), this ship nonetheless differs in some very important ways. Utilizing lightweight alloys and a prototype form of ion thruster, the Adrestia is capable of reaching truly mind-boggling speeds for a heavy assault vessel. While this makes it less sturdy than its predecessor, the lack of defensive plating is compensated for by state-of-the-art targeting systems, thoroughly optimized weapon hardpoints and upgraded warp scrambling capability. Don't let the lack of defense fool you; very few vessels out there can stand against the Adrestia toe to toe.

Many have speculated that due to recent friction between Caldari megacorporations, LD may be looking to beef up their own police force with these missile-spewing monstrosities.",12720000,92000,650,1,1,17950950,450,None,1825
11999,358,Vagabond,"The fastest cruiser invented to date, this vessel is ideal for hit-and-run ops where both speed and firepower are required. Its on-board power core may not be strong enough to handle some of the larger weapons out there, but when it comes to guerilla work, the Vagabond can't be beat. 
<br>Developer: Thukker Mix 
Improving on the original Stabber design, Thukker Mix created the Vagabond as a cruiser-sized skirmish vessel equally suited to defending mobile installations and executing lightning strikes at their enemies. Honoring their tradition of building the fastest vessels to ply the space lanes, they count the Vagabond as one of their crowning achievements.",11590000,80000,460,1,2,17944848,452,None,1943
12003,358,Zealot,"The Zealot is built almost exclusively as a laser platform, designed to wreak as much havoc as its energy beams can be made to. As a vanguard vessel, its thick armor and dazzling destructive power make it capable of cutting through enemy fleets with striking ease. Zealots are currently being mass-produced by Viziam for the Imperial Navy. 
<br>Developer: Viziam 
For their first production-ready starship design, Viziam opted to focus on their core proficiencies - heavy armor and highly optimized weaponry. The result is an extremely focused design that, when used correctly, can go toe-to-toe with any contemporary cruiser design.",12580000,118000,440,1,4,17956216,449,None,1751
12005,358,Ishtar,"While not endowed with as much pure firepower as other ships of its category, the Ishtar is more than able to hold its own by virtue of its tremendous capacity for drones and its unique hard-coded drone-control subroutines. 
<br>Developer: CreoDron 
Touted as ""the Ishkur's big brother,"" the Ishtar design is the furthest CreoDron have ever gone towards creating a completely dedicated drone carrier. At various stages in its development process plans were made to strengthen the vessel in other areas, but ultimately the CreoDron engineers' fascination with pushing the drone carrier envelope overrode all other concerns.",10600000,115000,560,1,8,17949992,451,None,1835
12011,358,Eagle,"Built on the shoulders of the sturdy Moa and improving on its durability and range, the Eagle is the next generation in Caldari gunboats. Able to fire accurately and do tremendous damage at ranges considered extreme by any cruiser pilot, this powerhouse will be the bane of anyone careless enough to think himself out of its range. 
<br>Developer: Ishukone 
Caldari starship design is showing a growing trend towards armaments effective at high ranges, and in this arena, as in others, Ishukone do not let themselves get left behind; the Eagle was intended by them as a counter to the fearsome long-range capabilities of Lai Dai's Cerberus ship.",11720000,101000,550,1,1,17062524,450,None,1894
12015,358,Muninn,"Commissioned by the Republic Fleet to create a powerful assault vessel for the strengthening of the Matari tribes as well as a commercial platform for the Howitzers and other guns produced by the Fleet, Boundless Creation came up with the Muninn. Heavily armored, laden with turret hardpoints and sporting the latest in projectile optimization technology, this is the very definition of a gunboat. 
<br>Developer: Boundless Creation 
Boundless Creation's ships are based on the Brutor tribe's philosophy of warfare: simply fit as much firepower onto your ship as is humanly possible. The Muninn is far from being an exception.",11750000,96000,515,1,2,17062768,452,None,1925
12019,358,Sacrilege,"Khanid's engineers have spent months perfecting the Sacrilege's on-board missile launcher optimization systems, making it a very effective assault missile platform. In addition, its supremely advanced capacitor systems make it one of the most dangerous ships in its class. 
<br>Developer: Khanid Innovation 
In an effort to maintain the fragile peace with the old empire through force of deterrence, Khanid Innovation have taken the Maller blueprint and morphed it into a monster. State-of-the-art armor alloys, along with missile systems developed from the most advanced Caldari designs, mean the Sacrilege may be well on its way to becoming the Royal Khanid Navy's flagship cruiser.",11750000,118000,615,1,4,17062600,449,None,1855
12023,358,Deimos,"Sharing more tactical elements with smaller vessels than with its size-class counterparts, the Deimos represents the final word in up-close-and-personal cruiser combat. Venture too close to this one, and swift death is your only guarantee. 
<br>Developer: Duvolle Labs 
Rumor has it Duvolle was contracted by parties unknown to create the ultimate close-range blaster cruiser. In this their engineers and designers haven't failed; but the identity of the company's client remains to be discovered.",11460000,112000,415,1,8,17062588,451,None,11859
32209,358,Mimir,"A highly experimental prototype created by Minmatar scientists, intended to combine the qualities of their front line heavy assault cruisers. Heavily plated and sporting additional thrusters, this ship is not to be taken lightly.

4292,515,Siege Module II,"An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a dreadnought's siege warfare abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the siege module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its offensive and defensive capabilities.

This results in a tremendous increase in damage, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Defensive benefits include improved self-repair and shield boosting effectiveness, as well as increased resistance to most forms of  electronic warfare. As a side effect of the ionic field created by the siege module, beneficial remote repair and capacitor transfer effects are ineffective against the fitted ship while the module is active.
In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship nor are you allowed to dock until out of siege mode.

Note: A siege module requires Strontium clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one siege module can be fitted to a dreadnought class ship.

This results in a great increase in the Force Auxiliary's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance. Defensive benefits include improved self-repair and shield boosting effectiveness, as well as increased resistance to most forms of  electronic warfare. As a side effect of the ionic flux created by the triage module, beneficial remote repair and capacitor transfer effects are ineffective against the fitted ship while the module is active.

The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the Force Auxiliary can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the Force Auxiliary able to dock until out of triage mode. Finally, any drones currently in space will be unable to deal damage when the module is activated.

Note: A triage module requires Strontium Clathrates to run and operate effectively. Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use.

25266,737,Gas Cloud Harvester I,"The core technology employed by Gas Harvesters dates back centuries, to a time when the extraction of material in space was still a growing industry. Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology, which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession to this day.

When the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from. Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed, there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time, Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries and economies in the process.

This one small improvement set the two harvesters above the standard, Tech I variant for many years. 

All that changed however when new, stable wormholes began proliferating across the cluster. As soon as the wormholes were discovered, so too, were the giant gas cloud pockets within the unknown systems they linked to. In a single day, the demand for Tech II Gas Cloud Harvested exploded. Research projects were hastily established and grants hurriedly thrown out to the most promising firms pursuing a redesign.

28788,737,Syndicate Gas Cloud Harvester,"The Syndicate harvester arose out of a joint research project undertaken by dozens of Station owners across the region. The residents and industrialists of Syndicate appreciated, more than most, the latent potential of the underground booster industry. Although their modified harvesters offered no improvements in yield, they were easier for newer pilots to fit. Their investment in more accessible harvesting technology paid off, when eventually the empires quietly backpedalled and legalized the production and sale of Synth boosters.

Additionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space mining operations around.

After extended negotiations, Ishukone finally closed a deal exchanging undisclosed technical data for the core innovations underpinning the original Thukker Tribes design allowing them to rapidly bring to the market the largest jump capable freighter of them all, the Rhea, a true behemoth of the stars.

Developer : Ishukone

Ishukone, always striving to be ahead of the competition, have proved themselves to be one of the most adept starship designers in the State.  A surprising majority of the Caldari Fleets ships of the line were created by their designers.  Respected and feared by their peers Ishukone remain amongst the very top of the Caldari corporate machine.

Now seeing widespread service with roving Thukker outrider detachments, the Nomad is rapidly becoming an essential part of Thukker life away from the great caravans.

Developer : Thukker Mix

Thukkers spend their entire lives forever wandering the infinite in their vast caravans.  As such their technology is based as much upon necessity as their ingenious ability to tinker.  Their ship designs therefore tend to based upon the standard empire templates but extensively modified for the Thukkers unique needs.

The Anshar's specially-developed cargo-manipulation drones allowed CreoDron to optimize their loading algorithms and fully utilize every nook and cranny of the ship's spacious interior, ensuring it more than holds its own amongst its peers.  

Developer : CreoDron

As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers but has recently begun to expand their design focus and employ drone techniques on whole other levels which has led some to question where this leap in technology came from.

30072,955,Loki Electronics - Emergent Locus Analyzer,"Emboldened by the development of other, more specialized subsystems, engineers and astrophysicists alike began to investigate modifications to a Strategic Cruiser that could aid their fellow scientists and explorers. The first reverse-engineering projects were predominantly focused on ways to improve a vessel's astrometrics capabilities. The two-pronged solution of boosting both the strength of the launchers and the probes they deployed proved to be the most popular design in the end. It was not long after the first designs were sold that others took notice and began to reverse-engineer their own. Soon enough, the subsystem was catapulted into mainstream Tech III subsystem manufacture, although perhaps for more than just that one reason.  

The first designers of the emergent locus analyzer noted an additional ??and entirely unintended ??effect in tractor beams. Not only did they reach further, but they would also pull in their cargo more quickly than normal tractor beams. It was an unexpected by-product of the processes that increased scan probe strength, but far from an undesirable one. Although it is not fully clear what part of the construction process enables this additional benefit, so long as the subsystem is built in that exact fashion, it will continue to provide it.

The Amarrians are suspected to have developed cloaking technology for the Legion around the same time as the first capsuleer designs began to surface. For almost a full week, Minmatar rebel camps deep inside Heimatar and Metropolis were subjected to ruthless guerilla attacks, almost unprecedented in their ferocity and viciousness.  Although initially confused by such a marked changed in their opponent's warfare philosophy, the Matari knew that each target had been a high profile objective for the Imperial Navy, and noted with deep suspicion how all of the squads had been spearheaded by Legions that could hit and fade with alarming ease. Few doubted who was behind the bloodshed. The Amarrians remained silent for the most part, the only official statement; that God's will had manifested itself in the heart of evil.

To many Gallente and Caldari, the development of the Proteus covert reconfiguration signaled a repeat of the technological arms race that arose from the ashes of Crielere. Once again seeking a balance of power, and entirely convinced that the Caldari were attempting to reverse-engineer their own cloak-capable Strategic Cruisers, the Federation diverted immense resources to their research. Private firms and the largest of conglomerates all played a role in development, offering up prototype designs and speculative theories that collectively resulted in some of the first Covert-Capable Proteus produced. It is not known who, or what organization led the project. Nor is known when, or where, the first Covert Reconfigurations were deployed. If it had not been for capsuleers developing the same designs, most people would have remained oblivious to their existence, just the way the Federation would have preferred.

This registry is based on the idea of concurrence, where firing mechanisms can recycle energy among multiple turret emissions. This recycled energy is not only sustainable, but more powerful as well, a marvel considering its normal power output relative to other turret systems. Projectile turrets can be modified to use this surplus power to not only augment projectile damage output, but also to make minute adjustments on the fly, offering increasing tracking speed and optimal range.

While researching Sleeper drone weapon systems, a group of Minmatar engineers discovered special similarities to the technology behind all Sleeper weapon types. Distilling the underlying mechanic to its essence produced this hardpoint configuration, which enabled projectile weapons and missile launchers to share power sources and energy supplies (most of which were advanced beyond modern standards). This offers a vast increase to the rate of fire of both weapon types. Attempts to merge this technology to other weapon groups have, as yet, proven unsuccessful.

The Loki's Covert Reconfiguration designs arose out of a collective will to respond to what was thought to be Amarrian aggression deep inside their home regions. Unlike many scientific and technological breakthroughs, it was not the Sebiestor tribe alone who ushered in the paradigm shift to covert-capable Strategic Cruisers. It was only through consultation and collaboration with many other tribes and sub-factions that something substantial began to take shape. 

The Krusual and Thukker are said to have played the most important roles, however, in realizing the final design; the Thukker by providing the cloaking technology, and the Krusual by convincing them to do so. How they achieved this, or what they may have promised remains a secret; the two tribes are notorious for having many, and keeping them all.

When fully intact, they deliver levels of power efficiency unrivalled by current technology. Unfortunately, whenever a Sleeper drone is destroyed, these engines are the first to go with them, making it difficult to emulate their functionality without the addition of other materials. 

To recreate a functional nanoengine housing, PPD fullerene fibers are combined with metallofullerenes and fullerene fiber conduits to rebuild the basic structures that once housed them. After that, the fused nanomechanical engines are connected to one another, forming a composite whole. 

Although mechanical engineers have theorized about this construction method for many decades, the process was always held back by a lack of fullerene material. It is said that only hours after the discovery of fullerite clouds in wormhole space, the empires used significant amounts of their fullerene stockpiles to produce these engines. The reasoning behind this is simply the staggering breadth of potential applications these engines have.

The addition of emergent combat analyzers expands the functionality to include more abstract combat calculations, such as comparative analyses of fleets and predictive IFF identifications.

After capturing the data, they then feed it directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously. Functions familiar to any capsuleer such as the overview, tactical overlay and hostile threat indicators are just a few examples of the device's capabilities. 

Although NVI technology has been around since the inception of the capsule, the addition of salvaged Sleeper drone components and the now widely available fullerene polymers has carried the functionality forward into the new Tech III paradigm. Even before the first Strategic Cruiser was built, engineers hypothesized about potential issues with an NVI trying to communicate with an almost limitless combination of subsystems.

Ultra-resilient armor plating, defensive nanoassemblers, electronics housing, and even the molecular-level circuitry itself are only a few of the near-countless roles that fullerene intercalated sheets can perform. Although unrivalled in their modularity, the cost of construction remains a barrier on supply; consequently, they remain a component to be used only when absolutely necessary.

Although they have many uses in the manufacture of armor plating, the distinguishing feature of the alloys is the level of modularity they allow in starship design.

Mechanical engineers first attempted to create the plating using plutonium metallofullerenes, but it was quickly discovered that even miniscule amounts of them had a sizeable impact on ship mass. When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. 

A solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting.

The synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting.

Fulleroferrocene power conduits have become an essential component in the construction of these new vessels for this very reason. The conduits can be remapped through a ship with relative ease, allowing for the near-endless variations of subsystems to be completely interchangeable without posing any problems of how to power them.",1,5,0,1,None,400000,1147,3720,0

Stranger yet, it almost seems as if it was lined with some kind of triggered-release corrosive. The self-destruct mechanism ??if that's even what it was ??only caused so much damage, and the acid didn't burn cleanly through the center of the drive. 

Even as a shadow of its former self, it can be combined with other components to form a fully functional warp drive.

Central system controllers lie at the heart of a starship's electronics systems. They are responsible for coordinating the flow of information between various analyzers and control nodes, monitoring subsystems, and ensuring they receive the appropriate supply of electrical power. Tackling such complex tasks simultaneously (and with near-zero latency) demands immense processing power and faultless, error-free programming. Traditionally, a CSC would comprise a significant portion of the cost in a starship's electronics systems, but the fullerene-based Sleeper designs have provided breakthroughs in the efficiency of circuitry and presented new and improved methods for increasing computational accuracy.

The distinctive design of Vallou's officer coats is inspired by historical images of high-ranking military members from the heyday of the Garoun Empire, ancestors of the Gallente Federation.

One of the rarest and most sought-after items in Vallou's renowned Limited Collection, the Silvershore greatcoat is also one of the most expensive articles of clothing ever created. From the top-quality Caillian leather to the burnished platinum clasps, every aspect of this stately raiment has been carefully shaped to evoke the mystery, grandeur and peril of the unexplored.

<font color=yellow>Military Specifications:</font> Heavy Fighter class vessel. Moderate microwarp velocity. Enhanced weapons systems. Reverse-engineering has been made possible through salvage of specific Sansha's Nation vessels.<br>
<font color=yellow>Additional Intelligence:</font> At this initial stage conclusions are hard to form, but early indications from the recovery of three individual bomber pilots ??all of them heavily augmented ??strongly indicates that these crew members are the same planetary abductees found in other Nation prototype vessels. Cross-referencing recovered DNA with missing persons reports has so far revealed little, though even at this stage the origin of these pilots is in little doubt.<br>
